# Paint Gauge
Hi there! Paint Gauge is a single-page web application for rating famous art pieces. It utilizes several API such as the Harvard Art Museum's and the Smithsonian Design Museum's API to display a multitude of art pieces that users can rate or just browse through. 

Paint Guage is using create-react-app and a Node.js backend with Express. It stores ratings and other information in a MongoDB database. Might incorperate GraphQL at some point
