# Paint Gauge
Hi there! Paint Gauge is a single-page web application for rating famous art pieces. It utilizes the Harvard Art Museum's API to display a multitude of art pieces that users can rate or just browse through. Paint Guage is using create-react-app and a Node.js backend with Express. It stores ratings and other information in a MongoDB database powered by Mongoose.

Paint Gauge is still very much a work in progress. It is currently hosted on Heroku at https://paint-gauge.herokuapp.com/
